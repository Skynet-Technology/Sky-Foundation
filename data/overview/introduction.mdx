We do a lot, from managing your infrastructure to growing your church // community!

## Motivation

At [Skynet](https://sky-net/), We wanted to build something for the churches and communities all around! 
We wanted to help some of them, make them grow and expand globally but we didn't know how. the how was the question.

After weeks of research, best practices and checking out others - Sky Foundation was born. Fine-tuned for any community or
church, locally or globally - we knew the how to grow // build each and everyone of them!
