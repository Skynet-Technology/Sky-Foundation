# Welcome!

Here at Sky Foundation, we have one mission - to build software that is redemptive, not exploitative 

> SF is part of the next evolution of Skynet, and one of the four arms of
> the future of Skynet Technology.
> [**Check it out!**](https://sky-net.ml)

We do a lot, from managing your infrastructure to growing your church // community!

## Motivation

At [Skynet](https://sky-net/), We wanted to build something for the churches and communities all around! 
We wanted to help some of them, make them grow and expand globally but we didn't know how. the how was the question.

After weeks of research, best practices and checking out others - Sky Foundation was born. Fine-tuned for any community or
church, locally or globally - we knew the how to grow // build each and everyone of them!

> We aren't just good, **we're better 🚀**

## Why Zag?

- **Powered by state machines 🌳**: Zag is built on top of the latest ideas in
  Statecharts. We don't follow the SCXML specifications, but we've created an
  API that we think will help us build more complex components fast.

- **Write once, use everywhere 🦄**: The component interactions are modelled in
  a framework agnostic way. We provide adapters for JS frameworks so you can use
  it in React, Solid, or Vue 3.

- **Focus on accessibility ♿️**: Zag is built with accessibility in mind. We
  handle many details related to keyboard interactions, focus management, aria
  roles and attributes.

- **Headless ✨**: The machine APIs are completely unstyled and gives you the
  control to use any styling solution you prefer.

- **Incremental adoption ✨**: Adopt the machines as you need them. Each
  component machine is an NPM package and can be installed individually so you
  can use them incrementally.

## Our Values

We strongly believe in our values, to put God first in any and everything we do - no matter what. Some of our values are - 

- We build software, no matter what it is - to make it redemptive and never **exploitative** ⚡️

- To never discriminate and to always **"respect"** everyone, for everyone is a masterpiece by God 🔥

- Oh, this is closer to our heart and we will never, ever abandon it - **"God First!"** 🚀
